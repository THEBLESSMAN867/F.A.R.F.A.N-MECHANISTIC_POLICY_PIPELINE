# executor_config.json

This file is used to configure the executor component of the system.

## Purpose

`executor_config.json` allows you to specify settings that control the behavior of the executor. This may include resource limits, execution environment options, logging preferences, or other runtime parameters.

## Valid Configuration Keys

- `max_concurrent_jobs` (integer): Maximum number of jobs the executor can run in parallel.
- `timeout_seconds` (integer): Default timeout for each job, in seconds.
- `log_level` (string): Logging verbosity (e.g., "info", "debug", "warn", "error").
- `resource_limits` (object): Resource constraints for jobs (e.g., CPU, memory).

> **Note:** The actual keys and their meanings may vary depending on your system. Please refer to the main documentation for a full list.

## Why is it empty by default?

The file starts empty (`{}`) because the executor can run with default settings. You only need to add configuration options if you want to override the defaults.
