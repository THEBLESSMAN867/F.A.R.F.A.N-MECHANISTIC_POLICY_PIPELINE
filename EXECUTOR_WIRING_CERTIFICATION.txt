EXECUTOR PARAMETRIZATION AND WIRING CERTIFICATION
============================================================

Certification: YES

Successful Checks: 116
Warnings: 2
Critical Issues: 0

Addendum – Continuous Enforcement (Section 12):
  • Verified pipeline runner now consumes SeedRegistry + VerificationManifest
    (see `src/saaaaaa/scripts/run_policy_pipeline_verified.py`) so executor
    wiring manifests include determinism + calibration metadata.
  • GitHub Actions workflows `contract-enforcement.yml` and
    `determinism-test.yml` enforce METHOD_SEQUENCE coverage, calibration version
    tracking, and reproducibility gates on every push and on a daily schedule.

Warnings:
  - Global metrics singleton exists - requires careful threading consideration
  - FrontierExecutorOrchestrator has shared global_causal_graph
