"""
Verification script for the sophisticated engineering operation.

This script provides the concrete evidence of the operation by:
1. Instantiating the Orchestrator with all its required dependencies.
2. Looping through 10 policy areas (PA01 to PA10).
3. Calling the 'execute_sophisticated_engineering_operation' for each area.
4. Writing the returned evidence to a verifiable JSON artifact, one for each
   policy area, in the 'reports/' directory.

This script is the ultimate proof of the successful and immaculate distribution.
